                           <p class="pb-3">There are several simple ways to add a code answer. They all begin with a google search. You may add a code response directly from your google search results, or you can click onto a web page from your search result and utilize the "Easy Code Snag" button to snag some code. Keep in mind that each of your code replies is linked to a Google search.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p class="pb-3">After doing a google search and clicking on a result, the Codeinu “ Easy Code Snag” button in the upper right corner will appear on any code example on the website. If you right-click that button, the code response will be saved automatically to your Codeinu code solutions.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p class="pb-3">After doing a google search and clicking on a result, if you want to edit the code solution before saving, all you need to do is click the “Easy Code Snag” button in the upper right corner. After that, the Codeinu code editor will come up, and you can make amends and then save the code snippet right to your Codeinu code solutions.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p class="pb-3">You can also save a code solution by using the keyboard shortcuts. After doing google search and clicking on a result, you select and highlight any code or text on the website and press Ctrl-g (or Command+g on Mac). Codeinu’s easy code snag editor will appear, then you can make amends for the code and save your solution by using the editor.</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">If you have a better code answer or just a new one, you can also add them right from any search results. Firstly, you go to the “ add a better one” link (right next to the number of search results) or ( pressing a). Then a code editor will appear and you can put your own code answer on. This code answer will be linked with your google search and the next time if you do the same or similar search the solution will pop up right at the top of your google search results.</p>
                        </div>

                           <h4 class="fs-20 pb-3 fw-bold">Adding a Video Answer</h4>
                           <p class="pb-3">Sometimes you have to use a short video or screen recording to elaborately illustrate or answer complicated technical questions. For instance, if you have a query that includes a task done in a UI rather than in code, it is better to answer these questions by a short screen recording rather than a simple text.</p>
                           <p class="pb-3">Codeinu makes adding a video/screen recording really easy. After google searching, click “Add Codeinu Answer” (or hit a) and then click on the video icon next to the recordings.</p>
                           <p class="pb-3">Click on Start Recording” and choose one option to record and then click “Share” to start the recording. Make sure that your recordings are clear and short enough cause the recordings are no more than 1 minute long. Click "Stop Recording" after you're finished recording.</p>
                           <p class="pb-3">You can check or view your video once you finished recording it, and recreate it if you want. In the normal Codeinu answer section, you can attach resource links or insert any note to your video and click “Save” to add it to your Codeinu code solutions. Answer with video will pop up in the same way as normal Codeinu solution. The next time when you do the same google search, the answer with video will pop up in the same way as the normal Codeinu solution, so you can get a better understanding by watching that video or screen recordings.</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">If you’re searching for a technical keyword that has been answered by others, code answers will pop up right at the top of your google search results.  For example, when you search “Adding a new element to object” and add a code solution to your Codeinu code solutions, the next time when you search the same question or a similar variant, the previous solution will display right at the top of your google search results.</p>

If you press “c” many times, it will cycle through copying the code answers to your clipboard, which is really helpful if you have more than one answers</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">o become a member of the team, any people you invite must accept the team invitations. When they accept the team invitation, you will be notified.</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">When putting a solution on Codeinu, you will see your team’s symbol above the answer. Choosing a team that you want to add the code snippets (the selected team will be highlighted green).</p>
                           <p class="pb-3">When adding an answer to Codeinu your group symbol will appear above the answer. Simply choose the group to which you want to add the feedback (selected team will be highlighted green).</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">Because your responses help other coders as well so it’s reasonable if you want to receive some gifts from them. You can briefly create a PayPal donation link by clicking to https://www.paypal.com/donate/buttons and turning on the button to receive donations from other users. Remember to use the “Shareable URL” paypal offers and put it into your “Paypal Donations Url” under My Account/Profile.</p>

                           <p class="pb-3">Any answer you add to your Codeinu code solutions can be presented to other developers. The usefulness of your answer decides whether it can be shown up to others or not. Whenever users see your solution, they have the chance to give you some money. This means that if your answer is useful for others, you are more likely to receive donations from them. Remember that donations are the incentive for developers to contribute helpful knowledge, so if you think their answer is useful, don’t hesitate to give them some gifts.</p>
